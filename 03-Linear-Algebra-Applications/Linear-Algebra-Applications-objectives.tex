\begin{enumerate}

\item Find the currents in electrical systems involving batteries and resistors, using both Gaussian elimination and Cramer's rule.
\item Find interpolating polynomials. Use the transpose and inverse of a matrix to solve the least squares regression problem of fitting a line to a set of data.
\item Find the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function. Utilize this decomposition to integrate rational functions.
\item Describe a Markov process. Explain how an eigenvector of the eigenvalue $\lambda=1$ is related to the limit of powers of the transition matrix.
\item Explain how to generalize the derivative to a matrix. Use this generalization to locate optimal values of the function using the second derivative test. Explain the role  of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in the second derivative test.
