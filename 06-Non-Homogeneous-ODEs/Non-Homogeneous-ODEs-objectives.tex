
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Explain Hooke's Law in regards to mass-spring systems, where there is an external force. Construct and solve differential equations which represent this physical model, with or without the presence of a damper and be able to interpret how solutions change based on changes in the model. 
	\item Understand the theory which relates solutions of homogeneous linear ODE's to non homogeneous ODEs. 
	\item Use the method of undetermined coefficients  to solve non homogeneous linear ODEs.
	\item Explain Kirchhoff's voltage law, Ohm's law, and how to model electrical circuits using 2nd order non homogeneous linear ODEs.  Illustrate how results about circuits can be translated into results about mass-spring systems.
