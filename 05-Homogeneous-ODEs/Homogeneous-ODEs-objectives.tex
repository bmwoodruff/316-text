

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Explain Hooke's Law in regards to mass-spring systems. Construct and solve differential equations which represent this physical model, with or without the presence of a damper.  
	\item Understand the vocabulary and language of higher order ODEs, such as homogeneous, linear, coefficients, superposition principle, basis, linear independence. 
	\item Solve homogeneous linear ODE's with constant coefficients (with and without Laplace transforms). In addition, create linear homogeneous ODE's given a basis of solutions, or the roots of the characteristic equation.
	\item Explain how the Wronskian can be used to determine if a set of solutions is linear independent.	Briefly mention the existence and uniqueness theorems in relation to linear ODEs, and give a reason for their importance.
\end{enumerate}
