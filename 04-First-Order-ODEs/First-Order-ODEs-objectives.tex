
\begin{enumerate}
\item Be able to interpret the basic vocabulary of differential equations. In particular, interpret the terms ordinary differential equation (ODE), initial value, initial value problem (IVP), general solution, and particular solution.
\item Use the three step modeling process (express, solve, and interpret) to analyze exponential growth and decay, Newton's law of cooling, mixing, and the logistics equation. 
\item Identify and solve separable ODES and exact differential forms. Use integrating factors and substitutions to solve additional ODEs.
\item Use Laplace transforms to solve first order ODEs.
\end{enumerate}
