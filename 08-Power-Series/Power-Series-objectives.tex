
\begin{enumerate}
\item Find and explain the use of Taylor polynomials, Talyor series, and Maclaurin series. Give examples for various common functions.
\item Explain how to use the ratio test to find the radius of convergence of a power series. 
\item Derive Euler's formula, and use it to explain why complex roots $a\pm bi$ of 2nd order ODE result in the solutions $e^{ax}\cos(bx)$ and $e^{ax}\sin(bx)$.
\item Explain how to differentiate, integrate, add, multiply, compose, and shift indices of power series.
\item Use the power series method to solve ODEs at ordinary points.
