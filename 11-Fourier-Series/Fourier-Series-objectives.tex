
\begin{enumerate}

\item Define period, and how to find a Fourier series of a function of period $2\pi$ and $2L$. 
\item Explain how to find Fourier coefficients using Euler formulas, and be able to explain why the Euler formulas are correct.
\item Give conditions as to when a Fourier series will exist, and explain the difference between a Fourier series and a function at points of discontinuity.
\item Give examples of even and odd functions, and correspondingly develop Fourier cosine and sine series.  Use these ideas to discuss even and odd half-range expansions.
