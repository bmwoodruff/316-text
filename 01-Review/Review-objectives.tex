
\begin{enumerate}

\item Graph basic functions by hand. Compute derivatives and integrals, in particular using the product rule, quotient rule, chain rule, integration by $u$-substitution, and integration by parts (the tabular method is useful for simplifying notation). Explain how to find a Laplace transform. 
\item Explain how to verify a function is a solution to an ODE, and illustrate how to solve separable ODEs.
\item Explain how to use the language of functions in high dimensions and how to compute derivatives using a matrix. Illustrate the chain rule in high dimensions with matrix multiplication.
\item Graph the gradient of a function together with several level curves to illustrate that the gradient is normal to level curves.
\item Explain how to test if a differential form is exact (a vector field is conservative) and how to find a potential.
