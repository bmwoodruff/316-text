
\begin{enumerate}


\item Explain the basic theory of systems of linear ODEs and the Wronskian for systems.
\item Convert higher order ODEs to first order linear systems.
\item Explain how to use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to diagonalize matrices. When not possible, use generalized eigenvectors to find Jordan canonical form.
\item Find the matrix exponential of a square matrix, and use it to solve linear homogeneous and nonhomogeneous ODEs. 
\item Give applications of systems of ODEs. In particular be able to setup systems of ODE related to dilution, electricity, and springs (use the computer to solve complex systems).
