\section{Preparation}

\noindent
This chapter covers the following ideas. When you create your lesson plan, it should contain examples which illustrate these key ideas. Before you take the quiz on this unit, meet with another student out of class and teach each other from the examples on your lesson plan. 

\input{02-Linear-Algebra-Arithmetic/Arithmetic-objectives}

Here are the preparation problems for this unit.  All of these problems come from this book (not Schaum's Outlines).  Remember that solutions appear at the end of each chapter.

%Day 1 we'll only look at matrix multiplication in class.  I'll introduce vector addition, scalar multiplication, the dot product, and then go to linear combinations. This leads immediately to matrix multiplication. Next we will focus on systems of equations and how to solve them.  I'll show how systems can be written in 4 ways, and then reduce a 2 by 2 system.  The next day we will focus on larger systems, and introduce rank and independence.  The next day I'll add in determinants and inverses, and hopefully get to eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

Please download and print all the problems. I have tried to keep the text short and readable, and I want you to read the text (reading 3-4 pages for every day of class will get you through the whole book). If you find errors or find some parts hard to read, please email me so that I can improve the text.




The problems listed below are found in the subsequent pages. The suggested problems are a minimal set of problems that I suggest you complete.
